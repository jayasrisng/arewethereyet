# follow the rabbit hole

navigation but make it actually human.

maps take you to the address, but never the *real* place you need. we kept ending up in weird hallways, wrong doors, random airport corners, and that one basement with the og google server lol. so we built something to fix that.

## what this is

our project “we will take you there” lets you:
- record a walking path using snap spectacles
- save it to the cloud
- replay it anytime with a hologram guide and ar dotted path
- sprinkle in fun facts, stories, history, or tiny easter eggs along the way
- share the route with your friends, family, guests or anyone who gets lost easily

it’s navigation but also a vibe. part tour guide, part reassurance, part storytelling.

## why we built it

we kept thinking about how our parents used to hold our hands and guide us around. or how tour guides tell stories about a place and make you feel connected to it.

the world is full of tiny hidden corners:
- the exact airbnb door inside a maze-like building
- the hallway that actually leads to room 302
- a small alley cafe locals love
- the right airport exit gate after customs
- where you parked your car
- the jen hsun huang basement lol

navigation should feel natural, not stressful. more like exploring a story.

## what it does

**ar path recording**
- built with lens studio using the spectacles interaction kit
- as you walk, the glasses drop spatial waypoints
- you can collect easter eggs for fun facts or context
- everything syncs smoothly along your recorded path

**ar playback**
- a tiny hologram guide floats in front and leads you
- dotted ar lines trace your exact steps
- subtle callouts appear like “enter here”, “go up”, “keybox on the right”
- narration + facts turn a route into a walking tour

## a good fit for

- museums and cultural institutions  
- universities, schools and campuses  
- big cities full of hidden small businesses  
- concerts, stadiums, expo halls  
- hospitals, hotels, airbnbs  
- airports (especially during transfers)  
- everyday life when you forget where you parked  

## tech stack

- snap spectacles  
- lens studio 5.12  
- spectacles interaction kit  
- depth cache  
- spatial waypoints  
- lens cloud (for persistence)  
- remote service gateway for ai features  
- typescript for lens logic  

## future plans

**short term**
- audio tts for fun facts  
- personalization via ai (age, interests, duration)  
- voice notes and accessibility tips  
- cloud saved routes  
- sharing routes as anchorable experiences  
- accessibility + audio-only modes  

**long term**
- city exploration routes by locals  
- airport cultural routes + terminal navigation  
- hologram collectibles + global leaderboard  
- support for phones and future xr glasses  
- ai reading airport maps or airbnb instructions to auto-generate paths  

## challenges

- precise indoor tracking without gps  
- keeping the hologram aligned on the real path  
- balancing simplicity with discovery and story  

## accomplishments

- working prototype that records and replays real routes  
- intuitive hologram guide  
- storytelling-first navigation  
- strong use cases for accessibility, tourism and daily life  
- clear plan to scale via ai  

## what we learned

- navigation is emotional. people want reassurance  
- storytelling moments make places feel alive  
- creators love dropping tours to hidden spots  
- indoor navigation is painfully underserved  
- pacing and clarity are everything in ar  

## try it

coming soon when the repo is public ready  
(for now dm us for a build or lens link)

## team

our team "we will take you there" enjoyed building this navigation that feels human
